# Store-Data-Analysis-
A simple dashboard made using pivot tables in Excel to present the Sales data for a store. I have used pie charts, column charts and combo chart to present the data in a meaningful way.
This report helps to identify:
1) Which age group is contributing most to Sales?
2) What is the percentage of men and women customers?
3) Which states have the highest orders?
